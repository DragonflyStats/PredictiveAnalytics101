- In areas of inter-laboratory quality control, method comparisons, assay validation and individual bioequivalence, etc., 
the agreement between observations and target (reference) values is of interest. 

- The mean of the squared difference between observations and target values (MSD) is a good measure of the total deviation. 
A new user-friendly statistic, the total deviation index (TDI(1-p)), is introduced that translates the MSD into an index
that can be directly compared to a predetermined criterion. 

- The TDI(1-p) describes a boundary such that a majority, 100(1-p) per cent, of the observations are within the boundary
(measurement unit and/or per cent) from their target values. Statistical inference using the sample counter part
(estimate) is presented. 

- A Monte Carlo experiment with 5000 runs was performed to confirm the estimate's validity.
Applications in laboratory performance and validation, as well as individual bioequivalence, are presented.
