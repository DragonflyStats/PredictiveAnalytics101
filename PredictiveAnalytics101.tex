A predictive model is not magic and it is not rocket science. It is actually a mathematical representation
of reality that offers a view based on science and statistics that uses data that is currently available to
predict the risk of an adverse event (or a preferred event) at some point in the future. The models, and
there are many, look for patterns in the data that may not always be evident and which seem linked to
an outcome of some sort. Depending on the data and the model it can do so in either a supervised
learning fashion, where the model describes a relationship between a set of independent attributes and
a dependent attribute or in an unsupervised learning fashion where the model, itself, will find
relationships in the data without reference to independent or dependent variables.

Dimensionality Reduction

Feature Selection / Variable Selection




The technical term for that type of analysis is multivariate analysis. Though certainly not a
totally inclusive listing, some knowledge of the following terms will help you understand the area of
predictive modeling better and make it easier for you to judge the value and the accuracy of models that
you create. Those terms are:
- Sensitivity and Specificity
- True and False Positives and Negatives
- Predictive Value and Positive Predictive Value
- Parametric vs. Non-Parametric
- Correlation Coefficient (R) and R-Squared
- Regression
- ROC curve (aka area under the curve)
