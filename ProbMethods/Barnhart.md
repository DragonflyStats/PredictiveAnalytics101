Coverage Probability and Total Deviation Index
% Barnhart

As elaborated by Lin and colleagues (Lin, 2000; Lin et al., 2002), an intuitive measure of
agreement is a measure that captures a large proportion of data within a boundary for allowed
observersâ€™ differences. The proportion and boundary are two quantities that correspond to
each other. If we set d0 as the predetermined boundary; i.e., the maximum acceptable
absolute difference between two observersâ€™ readings, we can compute the probability of absolute
difference between any two observersâ€™ readings less than d0. 

This probability is called
coverage probability (CP). On the other hand, if we set 0 as the predetermined coverage
probability, we can find the boundary so that the probability of absolute difference less than
this boundary is 0. This boundary is called total deviation index (TDI) and is the 1000
percentile of the absolute difference of paired observations. A satisfactory agreement may
require a large CP or, equivalently, a small TDI.

For J = 2 observers, let Yi1 and Yi2 be the
readings of these two observers, the CP and TDI are defined as
\[
CPd0 = Prob(|Yi1 âˆ’ Yi2| < d0), TDI0 = fâˆ’1(0)
\]
where fâˆ’1(0) is the solution of d by setting $f(d) = Prob(|Yi1 âˆ’ Yi2| < d) = 0$.
Estimation and inference on CPd0 and TDI0 often requires a normality assumption on
Di = Yi1 âˆ’ Yi2.Assume that Di is normally distributed with mean Î¼D and variance 2
D .
