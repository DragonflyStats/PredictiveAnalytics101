Total Deviation Index
====================
In areas of inter-laboratory quality control, method comparisons, assay validation and individual bioequivalence, etc., the agreement between observations and target (reference) values is of interest. The mean of the squared difference between observations and target values (MSD) is a good measure of the total deviation. A new user-friendly statistic, the total deviation index (TDI(1-p)), is introduced that translates the MSD into an index that can be directly compared to a predetermined criterion. 

The TDI(1-p) describes a boundary such that a majority, 100(1-p) per cent, of the observations are within the boundary (measurement unit and/or per cent) from their target values. Statistical inference using the sample counter part (estimate) is presented. A Monte Carlo experiment with 5000 runs was performed to confirm the estimate's validity. Applications in laboratory performance and validation, as well as individual bioequivalence, are presented.

Individual agreement between two measurement systems is determined using the total deviation index (TDI) or the coverage probability (CP) criteria as proposed by Lin (2000) and Lin et al. (2002). We used a variance component model as proposed by Choudhary (2007). Using the bootstrap approach, Choudhary (2007), and generalized confidence intervals, we construct bounds on TDI and CP. A simulation study was conducted to assess whether the bounds maintain the stated type I error probability of the test. We also present a computational example to demonstrate the statistical methods described in the paper.
