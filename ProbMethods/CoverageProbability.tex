%CoverageProbability

\subsection{Coverage probability}
This term refers to the probability that a procedure for 
constructing random regions will produce an interval containing, or covering, the 
true value. It is a property of the interval producing procedure, and is 
independent of the particular sample to which such a procedure is applied. We 
can think of this quantity as the chance that the interval constructed by such a 
procedure will contain the parameter of interest.
