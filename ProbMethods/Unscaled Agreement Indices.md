Unscaled Agreement Indices
================================
- Summary agreement indices based on the absolute difference of readings by observers are
grouped here as unscaled agreement indices. 
- They are usually defined as the expectation
of a function of the difference, or features of the distribution of the absolute difference.
- These indices include mean squared deviation, repeatability coefficient, repeatability variance,
reproducibility variance (ISO), limits of agreement (Bland and Altman, 1999), coverage
probability (CP) and total deviation index (TDI) (Lin et al., 2002 Choudhary and Nagaraja,
2007; Choudhary, 2007a).
