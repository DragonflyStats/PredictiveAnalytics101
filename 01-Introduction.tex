\item A predictive model is not magic and it is not rocket science. It is actually a mathematical representation
of reality that offers a view based on science and statistics that uses data that is currently available to
predict the risk of an adverse event (or a preferred event) at some point in the future.
\item  The models, and
there are many, look for patterns in the data that may not always be evident and which seem linked to
an outcome of some sort.

\item Depending on the data and the model it can do so in either a supervised
learning fashion, where the model describes a relationship between a set of independent attributes and
a dependent attribute or in an unsupervised learning fashion where the model, itself, will find
relationships in the data without reference to independent or dependent variables.
